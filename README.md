### Tech Round 2 (1.5 Hours)

Assignment

Design a login page. 
Email & Password.

Once signed in, data should persist even after reloading webpage.

Once logged in, display a list of boxes. Each box has a label below it.

Clicking on a box, makes a popup come up with an input field. Pressing esc makes the box disappear, while pressing enter changes the label of that box to what was entered. 

If login details are not present, then display a signup page. Ask for email address and password.

There needs to be a toggle, which switches the UI from light mode to dark mode.
And a button which switches the boxes from grid to list and vice versa
